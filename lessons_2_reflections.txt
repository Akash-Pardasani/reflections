1.What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need it?

When we initialise a directory (do this by creating a .git file)
(by git init) , we basically now can keep track of commits and changes.
The files in a directory can be added to the repository and hence 
the version conttrol can now be applied(not the right word).
We need it to apply(dammit) version control.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers ?

The staging area , as the name suggests , is the intermediate "area"
between repository and working directory. It would be natural to 
consider certain specific files to be aletred by a single commit.
For example , lets say there is a directory differnt files for 
differnt recipes.
Files related to cake and baking should be altered in a single commit 
as changes in one can possibly affect the others. 
Whereas a recipe for pizza , having no relationship whatsoever , 
should not be in the same commit as the cake ones. It should have
its own separate commit.

Staging area offers this feature of SELECTING which multiple files(if)
to be under a single commit.
