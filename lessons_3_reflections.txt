1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local ?

Under the situations where i would want others to contribute to my project rather than just me , maintaining a remote repository
helps.

2.Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay-up-to date with your remote repository ?

Since there would be a number of contributors to a project , I wont
want to pull all those commits to my remote as some of them wont be
required by me. Pulling them manually lets me keep a check on what i would like on my local repository.
