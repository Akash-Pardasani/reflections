1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local ?

Under the situations where i would want others to contribute to my project rather than just me , maintaining a remote repository
helps.

2.Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay-up-to date with your remote repository ?

Since there would be a number of contributors to a project , I wont
want to pull all those commits to my remote as some of them wont be
required by me. Pulling them manually lets me keep a check on what i would like on my local repository.

 3. Describe the differennces between forks , clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other ?
 
 Forking a repository means "cloning" an existing git repository onto your github account. Forking refers to the process
 of cloning a repository on to your remote pc , adding a remote and then pushing it to GitHub. Cloning is the process
 of getting a copy of the git repository on to your local pc.
 Branches are a completely different thing. Forking is used when , say I want to build a modified version of 
 something else is building entirely. He wouldn't want such modifications , so I would rather like to make my own
 project but I need the existing files and versions. So I would fork it to create a new repository on Github.
 I would clone someting when I want somebody's work and I want to use it for myself , rather than sharing it .
